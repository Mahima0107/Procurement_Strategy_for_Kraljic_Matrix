# Procurement_Strategy_for_Kraljic_Matrix

Summary: This project analyzes a synthetic procurement dataset using the Kraljic Matrix framework to classify items based on supply risk and profit impact. Led a procurement strategy initiative to enhance supplier segmentation and sourcing efficiency through the implementation of the Kraljic Matrix—an analytical framework that categorizes purchases across two key dimensions: profit impact (strategic importance) and supply risk (market complexity) .
The goal is to assist strategic decision-making by:
* Segmenting products into Kraljic quadrants
* Identifying high-risk and high-impact items
* Analyzing environmental and geopolitical factors
* Building a predictive model to auto-classify new items¶

In this dataset There are 11 columns and 1000 rows.
Algorithm Used: K Nearest Neighbors , Naive Bayes , Logistic Regression , Support Vector Machine , Linear Regression , Gradient Boosting , Random Forest , Adaboost Algorithms .
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
